# Multiplication Table Generator

This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a classic programming concept: using a **`for` loop** to perform a repetitive task. The application prompts the user to enter a number and then generates its complete multiplication table from 1 to 10, printing each line to the console.

This is a great example for learning about user input with the `Scanner` class and mastering the fundamentals of loop structures in Java.
